        <p>Today I’m going to tell some stories about the smell. </p>
<p>I remember last fall there was a walkathon fundraising event in the company, and my colleagues and I registered for it. It was a night walk in Ditan park. When I walked through the park towards the north gate, I smelt a different air: There was no street light in the park—I can barely see the surroundings. But in the twilight, walking along the footpath, on my right hand, the old, dark red city wall quietly standing besides me, on the left hand, in the distance, several people were talking and ready for the night walk. And along the footpath, all above me and surrounded me, were pine trees. That different smell of air is the smell of the pine trees. That smell was so adorable and natural, and I even couldn’t move a step. Those days I was busy for a lot of things: working, band practicing, hanging out with friends, hardly have time to get along with myself. And at that moment, in that smell of pine trees with myself, I just hope that smell and feeling would last forever.  </p>
<p>In the TV series <good doctor>, there is also a scene impressed me a lot. A man called Murphy and his best friend Lea, which becomes his girlfriend later, were going together for the first time. they were driving through a forest. Lea said: ‘you know I remember every important thing that has ever happened to me, based on what song I was listening to at that time.’ Murphy said: ‘I remember smells. Like our parking garage smells like fabric softener, and when my brother died it smelled like burnt food’. Lea asked: ‘what are you smelling right now?’ Murphy turned his head out the window for a while and said: ‘Pine trees.’ At that time, they were sitting in Lea’s grandfather’s red vintage car, driving through a pine forest. It was a bright summer, and I think Murphy would never forget that smell.  </p>
<p>Another story goes back to the first time that I was traveling alone 4 years ago. At that time, I was studying abroad, and decided to travel to Estonia and Latvia, these two countries I have never heard before. To save money, I choose a hostel. It was hard to find the place of that hostel, I arrived in the afternoon, the sun was bright outside, but the doorway was quite dark and cold, seems like something strange would happen in the thrilling movie. Walking in the hall, a cold reception poked his head out of the tiny window, and I paid 9 euros for one night, and got a key for my bed. Walking in the hostel was like walking in a maze. The corridor was narrow and dark, and quiet. I walk through the rooms along the way, and there seems no one in that building. I finally found my bed. There was no roommate in that room yet, all my attention was focused on the closet. The big, tall, dark yellow closet, with a large mirror embed in it. I was suddenly afraid of something strange would reflect on the mirror, or someone would hide in the closet. But I cannot scare myself, because it seems I have no roommate today, if there wasn’t another person hidden in the closet. </p>
<p>I put my luggage away and took a new lipstick from my bag. I haven’t used that lipstick before. Unscrew the lid and I tried it on. It smells like plum, sweet, a little bit tart and sour, and fresh. I wear the lipstick the whole day, wondering around the city, alone. After the travelling, out of nowhere I haven’t used that lipstick for a long while. While half a year later, when I open that lipstick for the second time, I suddenly remember something. I smell that tart fresh smell of plum, my mind suddenly went back to the time in Estonia, the first solo travelling, that huge closet in the quiet hostel, the first smell of plum-liked lipstick, and those curious but a little scared mementos.</p>
<p>I remember the smell, a shampoo brand which my ex-boyfriend always use, after breaking up I had never bought it for years; I remember the smell, the smell like sweet mothball in my hometown, every time I went back home that was the first smell. I remember the smell of Osmanthus flower, that was last year I live with my boyfriend for a couple of month, at night we walk along the alley at night and at the end there was an Osmanthus tree.</p>
<p>The other day, it was a sunny morning. After a week of quarantine, I went out for the first time. I see the fresh blooming flowers, I hear the noisy sparrow, I smell the grass and earth, and I smelt spring coming. </p>
