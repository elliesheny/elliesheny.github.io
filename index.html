            <p>Today I’m going to tell some stories about the smell. </p>
<p>I remember last fall there was a walkathon fundraising event in the company, and my colleagues and I registered for it. It was a night walk in Ditan park. When I walked through the park towards the north gate, I smelt a different air: There was no street light in the park—I can barely see the surroundings. But in the twilight, walking along the footpath, on my right hand, the old, dark red city wall quietly standing besides me, on the left hand, in the distance, several people were talking and ready for the night walk. And along the footpath, all above me and surrounded me, were pine trees. That different smell of air is the smell of the pine trees. That smell was so adorable and natural, and I even couldn’t move a step. Those days I was busy for a lot of things: working, band practicing, hanging out with friends, hardly have time to get along with myself. And at that moment, in that smell of pine trees with myself, I just hope that smell and feeling would last forever.  </p>
<p>In the TV series <good doctor>, there is also a scene impressed me a lot. A man called Murphy and his best friend Lea, which becomes his girlfriend later, were going together for the first time. they were driving through a forest. Lea said: ‘you know I remember every important thing that has ever happened to me, based on what song I was listening to at that time.’ Murphy said: ‘I remember smells. Like our parking garage smells like fabric softener, and when my brother died it smelled like burnt food’. Lea asked: ‘what are you smelling right now?’ Murphy turned his head out the window for a while and said: ‘Pine trees.’ At that time, they were sitting in Lea’s grandfather’s red vintage car, driving through a pine forest. It was a bright summer, and I think Murphy would never forget that smell.  </p>
<p>Another story goes back to the first time that I was traveling alone 4 years ago. At that time, I was studying abroad, and decided to travel to Estonia and Latvia, these two countries I have never heard before. To save money, I choose a hostel. It was hard to find the place of that hostel, I arrived in the afternoon, the sun was bright outside, but the doorway was quite dark and cold, seems like something strange would happen in the thrilling movie. Walking in the hall, a cold reception poked his head out of the tiny window, and I paid 9 euros for one night, and got a key for my bed. Walking in the hostel was like walking in a maze. The corridor was narrow and dark, and quiet. I walk through the rooms along the way, and there seems no one in that building. I finally found my bed. There was no roommate in that room yet, all my attention was focused on the closet. The big, tall, dark yellow closet, with a large mirror embed in it. I was suddenly afraid of something strange would reflect on the mirror, or someone would hide in the closet. But I cannot scare myself, because it seems I have no roommate today, if there wasn’t another person hidden in the closet. </p>
<p>I put my luggage away and took a new lipstick from my bag. I haven’t used that lipstick before. Unscrew the lid and I tried it on. It smells like plum, sweet, a little bit tart and sour, and fresh. I wear the lipstick the whole day, wondering around the city, alone. After the travelling, out of nowhere I haven’t used that lipstick for a long while. While half a year later, when I open that lipstick for the second time, I suddenly remember something. I smell that tart fresh smell of plum, my mind suddenly went back to the time in Estonia, the first solo travelling, that huge closet in the quiet hostel, the first smell of plum-liked lipstick, and those curious but a little scared mementos.</p>
<p>I remember the smell, a shampoo brand which my ex-boyfriend always use, after breaking up I had never bought it for years; I remember the smell, the smell like sweet mothball in my hometown, every time I went back home that was the first smell. I remember the smell of Osmanthus flower, that was last year I live with my boyfriend for a couple of month, at night we walk along the alley at night and at the end there was an Osmanthus tree.</p>
<p>The other day, it was a sunny morning. After a week of quarantine, I went out for the first time. I see the fresh blooming flowers, I hear the noisy sparrow, I smell the grass and earth, and I smelt spring coming. </p>

          <p>回想起来自己已经两年没有写博客啦。这样没有记录的生活，再回想起来，竟然不记得多少回忆的瞬间：当然，如果硬着头皮想想，我还是能记起两年来的每个瞬间，可是以后呢？</p>
<p>2019年的这些瞬间，有些是现在想起来都觉得幸福和快乐的，有些呢，有些我只希望把那些瞬间永远的掩埋在那些时间里，然后再立上一座墓碑。</p>
<h4 id="一月"><a href="#一月" class="headerlink" title="一月"></a>一月</h4><p>想想2019年的一年，年初的时候我在哪里？刚刚去boc山里的项目，为了可视化报表的事情而加班，一直一直加班到春节前。那时候的目标很简单：和boc的兄弟们融入到一起，然后尽力把自己手上负责PowerBI和服务器所有开发的事情做完。重复地加班，在中关村的公司，和兄弟们一起奋斗的感觉是很幸福的。也是那段时间后PowerBI的从头到尾都让我有了一些底气。</p>

            <p>（翻出来三四年前的、没有写完的一篇流水日记，就让它保持没有写完的样子吧！）</p>
<p>好久没有吃好久就想吃的东西了，明天去吃一只蛋糕，就近到芳草地吧！</p>
<p>这个假期的状态就是不想让自己忙起来。应该是上学期忙怕了，假期里就只想放空，于是在我写这个的时候好想去唱歌诶。所以这个不是假期的假期都做了些什么呢。</p>
<hr>
<p>我觉得我是个好幸福的人，上班第一天坐在旁边的小伙伴是个中财的小胖胖叫羊羊，长得很凶的样子，心地却特别特别善良，每天上下班都在哇啦哇啦说话，今天股票又血崩啦，明天中信又抓起来了几个人啦，blablabla…吃饭吃的也不是很多，但是不会运动，看起来两百多斤的样子，于是走起路来就像是小企鹅一样吧唧吧唧的，每天早上去的很早，吧唧吧唧，然后回来得也早，吧唧吧唧，中午给我们打汤，吧唧吧唧，又对每个人很好，别人有事情他都能够想着，吧唧吧唧～～<br>然后羊羊旁边坐着的是可漂亮的女生anna，后来发现她跟我是一个宿舍的诶，然后后来渐渐发现anna是个安静可爱的女生，每天上班走路走得快，吃饭吃得快，做事做得快，果然是每个人都有特别厉害的地方。</p>
<hr>
<p>每天三个人在一起吃饭，上班，下班，唠嗑，今天他们都出去约了可是我没有地方可以约，于是我又坐在了自习室，写着我的东西，思考着我的问题，总觉得自己好忙好忙，而在这好忙好忙的过程中却越来越不愿意做事情，后来的时候，总觉得有些悲观，什么事情都做不好的感觉，又越来越不能掌控自己的时间了。这个时候我想我是时间上出了问题，自己心态也出了问题，每天不能沉下心来做自己要做的事情，这是为什么呢。</p>
<p>我想了又想，是自己想要的太多吗？可是这跟我到底心情情况是怎样是没有关系的呀。后来我想，是我自己有太多记录时间的东西了，导致每一样都没办法做好弄好。</p>
<p>最开始的时候我买了一块钱的1-3-5todo，觉得它设计的特别好，用了两个月之后就没有再用下去然后…</p>
